## üìä Key Metrics & Analysis

The dashboard is built around a central dataset and features visualizations for the following key areas:

### **1. Executive KPIs**

* **Total Employee Count** and **Active Employee Count**.
* **Attrition Count** and the overall **Attrition Rate**.
* **Average Employee Age**.

### **2. Attrition Breakdown**

* **Department-Wise Attrition:** Analysis of turnover rates across different departments (e.g., Sales, R&D, HR) to pinpoint areas with the highest risk.
* **Attrition by Job Role:** Identifies which specific job roles (e.g., Sales Executive, Laboratory Technician) are experiencing the most significant losses.
* **Attrition by Demographic:** Visualization of attrition across **Age Groups**, **Gender**, **Education Level**, and **Marital Status**.
* **Employee Sentiment:** Key metrics on factors like **Job Satisfaction** and **Work-Life Balance Rating** to correlate with turnover.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

* **Microsoft Excel:** Used for all data cleaning, transformation (using formulas and Power Query/Pivot Tables), visualization (charts and graphs), and creating the final interactive dashboard design.
* **Data Source:** A simulated or anonymized corporate HR dataset containing detailed employee records.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* `HR_DASHBOARD.xlsx`: The main Excel file containing the raw data, pivot tables, and the final interactive dashboard sheets.
* `data/HR_Data.csv`: (Optional: You can save your raw data as a CSV and include it here) The original dataset used for the analysis.
* `screenshots/`: (Optional: Highly Recommended) Folder containing high-resolution images of the final dashboard.
